[Turn 1] +350 tokens (total: 350)
  TOOL: look({})
  OUT:  You are in the station's airlock. Emergency lights pulse red. The outer hatch is sealed shut — vacuum on the other side. A door leads into the corridor to the north.
[Turn 2] +428 tokens (total: 778)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Corridor.

A long metal corridor stretches before you. Sparks drip from damaged ceiling panels. Doors lead to the bridge (north), engine room (east), and med bay (west). The airlock is t
[Turn 3] +556 tokens (total: 1334)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'west'})
  OUT:  You enter the Med Bay.

A small medical bay with overturned supply carts. A crew log sits on the counter — it might have useful information. The corridor is to the east.
[Turn 4] +638 tokens (total: 1972)
  TOOL: take({'item': 'crew log'})
  OUT:  You pick up the crew log.
[Turn 5] +681 tokens (total: 2653)
  TOOL: read({'item': 'crew log'})

[Turn 7] +896 tokens (total: 4356)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'east'})
  OUT:  You enter the Engine Room.

The engine room is pitch black. You can barely see anything. You hear the hum of dormant machinery. Near the entrance, you feel something on a shelf — it might be a flashli
[Turn 8] +993 tokens (total: 5349)
  TOOL: take({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You pick up the flashlight.
[Turn 9] +1033 tokens (total: 6382)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You switch on the flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness. You can see the engine core now — and something glinting under a pile of debris near the wall. It looks like a keycard.
[Turn 10] +1123 tokens (total: 7505)
  TOOL: take({'item': 'keycard'})
  OUT:  You pick up the keycard.

[Turn 12] +1265 tokens (total: 9947)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

The bridge is silent. A large console dominates the center of the room. Its screen is dark — it looks like it needs a keycard to activate. The corridor is to the south.
[Turn 13] +1360 tokens (total: 11307)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'keycard'})
  OUT:  You slide the keycard into the console. Screens flicker to life. The station's distress beacon activates — a rescue signal pulses out into deep space.
