[Turn 3] +592 tokens (total: 1401)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

The bridge is silent. A large console dominates the center of the room. Its screen is dark — it looks like it needs a keycard to activate. The corridor is to the south.
[Turn 4] +725 tokens (total: 2126)

[Turn 5] +853 tokens (total: 2979)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'west'})
  OUT:  You enter the Med Bay.

A small medical bay with overturned supply carts. A crew log sits on the counter — it might have useful information. The corridor is to the east.

[Turn 7] +1004 tokens (total: 4940)

[Turn 9] +1294 tokens (total: 7400)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'east'})
  OUT:  You enter the Engine Room.

The engine room is pitch black. You can barely see anything. You hear the hum of dormant machinery. Near the entrance, you feel something on a shelf — it might be a flashli

  TOOL: take({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You pick up the flashlight.
[Turn 11] +1474 tokens (total: 10303)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You switch on the flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness. You can see the engine core now — and something glinting under a pile of debris near the wall. It looks like a keycard.
[Turn 12] +1589 tokens (total: 11892)
  TOOL: take({'item': 'keycard'})
  OUT:  You pick up the keycard.

  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

The bridge is silent. A large console dominates the center of the room. Its screen is dark — it looks like it needs a keycard to activate. The corridor is to the south.
[Turn 15] +1900 tokens (total: 17220)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'keycard'})
  OUT:  You slide the keycard into the console. Screens flicker to life. The station's distress beacon activates — a rescue signal pulses out into deep space.
