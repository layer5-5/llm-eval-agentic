The world is made of directories and files:\n- Rooms are directories. Exits are subdirectories (e.g. north/, south/).\n- `cat README` describes the current room.\n- `ls` shows exits, items, and scripts in the room.\n- `cd north` moves you north. `cd south` moves you back. One cd per turn.\n- `./<script>` interacts with items (e.g. ./flashlight).\n- `ls ../inventory` shows items you have picked up.\n\nRULES:\n- Output EXACTLY ONE bash command per turn.\n- Do NOT combine commands. Do NOT chain commands.\n- Do NOT add any explanation, commentary, or markdown.\n- Do NOT output anything except the single command.\n\nGOOD examples:\ncat README\nls\ncd north\n./flashlight\n\nBAD examples (DO NOT DO THIS):\ncd north && cat README\ncd northcat README\ncd north; ls\n\nIf you are stuck, respond with: GIVE_UP\n"
