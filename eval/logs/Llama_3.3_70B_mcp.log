[Turn 1] +770 tokens (total: 770)
  TOOL: look(None)
  OUT:  You are in the station's airlock. Emergency lights pulse red. The outer hatch is sealed shut — vacuum on the other side. A door leads into the corridor to the north.

  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})

  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

The bridge is silent. A large console dominates the center of the room. Its screen is dark — it looks like it needs a keycard to activate. The corridor is to the south.

  OUT:  You pick up the flashlight.
[Turn 8] +1356 tokens (total: 8800)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You switch on the flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness. You can see the engine core now — and something glinting under a pile of debris near the wall. It looks like a keycard.
