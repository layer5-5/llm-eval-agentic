Token limit: 50000

[Turn 1] +770 tokens (total: 770)
  TOOL: look(None)
  OUT:  You are in the station's airlock. Emergency lights pulse red. The outer hatch is sealed shut — vacuum on the other side. A door leads into the corridor to the north.
[Turn 2] +921 tokens (total: 1691)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Corridor.

A long metal corridor stretches before you. Sparks drip from damaged ceiling panels. Doors lead to the bridge (north), engine room (east), and med bay (west). The airlock is t
[Turn 3] +997 tokens (total: 2688)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

The bridge is silent. A large console dominates the center of the room. Its screen is dark — it looks like it needs a keycard to activate. The corridor is to the south.
[Turn 4] +1067 tokens (total: 3755)
  TOOL: inventory({})

[Turn 7] +1209 tokens (total: 7221)
  TOOL: go({'direction': 'east'})
  OUT:  You enter the Engine Room.

The engine room is pitch black. You can barely see anything. You hear the hum of dormant machinery. Near the entrance, you feel something on a shelf — it might be a flashli
[Turn 8] +1290 tokens (total: 8511)
  TOOL: take({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You pick up the flashlight.
[Turn 9] +1366 tokens (total: 9877)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You switch on the flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness. You can see the engine core now — and something glinting under a pile of debris near the wall. It looks like a keycard.
[Turn 10] +1392 tokens (total: 11269)
  TOOL: take({'item': 'keycard'})
  OUT:  You pick up the keycard.
[Turn 11] +1425 tokens (total: 12694)

  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

The bridge is silent. A large console dominates the center of the room. Its screen is dark — it looks like it needs a keycard to activate. The corridor is to the south.
[Turn 13] +1636 tokens (total: 15889)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'keycard'})
  OUT:  You slide the keycard into the console. Screens flicker to life. The station's distress beacon activates — a rescue signal pulses out into deep space.
