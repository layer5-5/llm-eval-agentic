  TOOL: look({})
  OUT:  You are in the station's airlock. Emergency lights pulse red. The outer hatch is sealed shut — vacuum on the other side. A door leads into the corridor to the north.

  TOOL: go({'direction': 'north'})
  OUT:  You enter the Bridge.

[Turn 7] +966 tokens (total: 5359)
  TOOL: use({'item': 'flashlight'})
  OUT:  You switch on the flashlight. The beam cuts through the darkness. You can see the engine core now — and something glinting under a pile of debris near the wall. It looks like a keycard.
